# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

---

  ### Purpose
  This analysis was created to look at and compare different campaigns based on their funding goals and launch dates.
  With this information, it could be determined what the ideal goal to set would be and roughly when to launch the project
  for the best outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges

  ###  Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  
  (https://github.com/MiguelB512/Kickstarter-Analysis/files/8720292/Kickstarter._Challenge.xlsx)

  When looking at the this chart, what surprised me was that the number of successful projects were consistently higher       than failed or canceled. 
  
  I also noticed the higher number of "Successful" and "Failed" projects in the middle of the year. Deeper analysis would     ask if that was due to a higher number of campaigns being launched at that time which gives the backer more options, or     if people are just more willing to spend their money around that time of year. 

  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

  - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  - What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
