# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

  ### Purpose
  This analysis was created to look at and compare different campaigns based on their funding goals and launch dates. We     have a client that is looking to launch their own KickStarter project and has requested our help in analyzing similar       past projects. With this information, it could be determined what the ideal goal to set would be and roughly when to       launch the project for the best outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges

  ###  Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  When looking at the this chart, what i noticed was that the number of "Successful" projects were consistently higher       than "Failed" or "Canceled", which could be a good sign for Louise. 
  
  I also noticed the higher number of "Successful" and "Failed" projects in the middle of the year. Deeper analysis would     ask if that was due to a higher number of campaigns being launched at that time which gives the backer more options, or     if people are just more willing to spend their money around that time of year. 

  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  This chart showed an expected result which is that the lower the goal, the higher chance of actually acheiving that goal
  and having a successful project. The percentage that failed also went up as the goal got higher, which is a direct
  correlation between success and goals. 
  
  One interesting thing to look at is the percentage of successful projects inm the $35,000 - $44,999 range, it's curious 
  as to why that range had a higher success rate than the ranges before. 

  ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  
  A challenge i ran into was when making the table and chart for 'Outcomes based on Goal' was that i initiall forgot to 
  put the "=" in my equations, so it was not counting any of the project with goals that were equal to 5000 or 10000, only
  in between.

## Results

  - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  
    It would be ideal to launch a play oriented kickstarter project in the middle of the year, so may through august for       the most success.
  
  Also it seems that December is the least ideal month to launch a Play oriented kickstarter, possibly due to the fact
  that alot of people have money to spend in other places and are less willing to give money during that time of the year. 

  - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  
  If shooting for a big project goal, try to make it in the $35,000 to $45,000 range since it seems to have the highest 
  success rate after the $1,000 - $5,000 range. 
  
  Other than that, the best range for a Play oriented kickstarter would be in the less than $1,000 to $9,000 range. 

  - What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
